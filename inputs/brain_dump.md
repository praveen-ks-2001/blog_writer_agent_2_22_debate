I want to write a blog about python debugger - pdb. Because debugging a big part of code could be very tricky. its not very efficient to write print statements and run again and again, sometimes i need to test multiple if scenarios - then i need to run again and again, but pdb makes it lot easier because now i can just change the state of the variable on fly, test out things , etc. etc. 
Also print statements work as long as you have edit access of the code, otherwise very tricky - so at end or somewhere i also want to talk about how can i programatcially set breakpoints in the code, without modifying the source code - this is power of pdb. 
there is also postmorterm thing - which would make me go into pdb if there is any exception and all thsoe sort of things.
I want to explain like someone who is reading about if for the first time - it should be very intutitional for them. Cover basicas like what is stack, frame, and how using pdb you can manuever. Then important commands what it does, etc etc. so cover all of this thing with a story.
